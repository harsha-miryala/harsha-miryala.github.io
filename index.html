                <p>Santa Barbara, CA, June 2023 – Sep 2023</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Streamlined and optimized vendor requests within the Screenings team, resulting in a 2x reduction in screening request costs.</li>
                    <li>Developed a robust infrastructure using Terraform in Datadog, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting for vendor request failures, reducing downtime to just 5 minutes. This ensured a modular design and improved the onboarding time for new vendors.</li>
                    <li>Spearheaded the migration of data storage from DynamoDB (NoSQL) to RDBMS (SQL), implemented essential indexes and views, and significantly improved application speed by 35%. This facilitated visibility and learning for other teams.</li>

                <h3>Senior Member Technical - D. E. Shaw</h3>
                <p>Hyderabad, India, June 2019 – Aug 2022</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acted as the principal contact for Oil fundamental data and dealt with data abstraction, validation, storage, access, analysis, visualization, and forecasting and enhanced the speed and efficiency of existing systems using - TDD, DRY and Modular design.</li>
                    <li>Developed a generic, robust and scalable API capable of seamlessly extracting smartly cached data from multiple vendors (~ 1 TB). This enhanced the speed of all applications by ~10 times, enforcing centralized access and a single point of failure.</li>
                    <li>Constructed a generic procedure for storing causal (time-dependent) data in MySQL through parallelization and optimizing the existing framework. This resulted in update queries running 8 times faster and was thus later adopted by other teams in the firm.</li>
                    <li>Brought down the run-time of time-sensitive reports by 10x through smart caching leveraging Redis (in-memory cache), HDF5 (disk cache) and distributed parallelization for data access API and resource-intensive analyses, thereby giving the team an edge.</li>
                    <li>Improved the turn-around time for onboarding tasks to ~1 day (a drop of 90%) by developing a generic infrastructure for data downloaders, charting interfaces and reports. Also, ensured robustness in the design, which brought down the failure rate/resolution time by 8 folds and also proved quite valuable during COVID-19 when numerous new vendors had to be tracked.</li>
                    <li>Collaborated closely with data analysts on data cleaning, pre-processing, and the development of fundamental models, including jet fuel demand prediction, gasoline export estimation, and crude balance forecasts, which proved crucial during COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>Introduced parallelism for large data analyses and created a versatile infrastructure for one-off prediction models.</li>
